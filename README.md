# About Me

<!-- <img style='float: left; margin: 0px 20px 5px 0px;'  src='./img/bal_phd_photo.jpg' width=150/> -->

Born in August 3rd, 1991, in a small town in Tanhuato, a small town in the county of Michoacan, in Mexico. At the age of 18, I had to move to the city of Morelia to enroll as a college student. In 2014, I received my Bachelor's degree with a major in Electronics Engineering at the Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolas de Hidalgo (UMSNH). In 2017, I received my Master's degree in Electric Engineering with a Control Systems specialty, at the same university. In 2022, I got my Ph.D. degree in Electric Engineering, at the UMSNH also.

My main subject of interest is Machine Learning, in special its sub-area of Reinforcement Learning. In this regard, I have used Python and PyTorch to conduct my research. Nevertheless, I'm also familiar with other ML frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras.
