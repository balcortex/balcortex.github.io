# Work Experience

### Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolas de Hidalgo – Division of Graduate Studies – Faculty of Electrical Engineering

*Research Scientist, 2018 – 2022*

* Managed data acquisition and conducted extensive cleaning processes for irradiance and temperature sensors over a period of 4 years, encompassing a dataset of over four million measurements. Cleaning procedures included noise reduction, outlier detection, and handling missing values.
* Conducted multiple time series forecasting experiments, focusing on areas such as electricity generation and consumption, as well as local irradiance. These experiments involved the exploration of various neural network architectures and rigorous hyper-parameter optimization techniques. This research activity resulted in an international conference paper.
* Led the development of a novel method for characterizing photovoltaic panels utilizing artificial neural networks. This innovative approach significantly expedites the modeling process for real panels, facilitating faster simulations. The method was recognized for its contribution and was granted a journal paper.
* Innovated a new maximum power point tracking (MPPT) technique for photovoltaic systems, specifically designed to operate effectively under fast-changing environmental conditions without the requirement of an irradiance sensor. Leveraging deep neural networks, this method dynamically controls the system's operation point, ensuring optimal power generation. The development of this technique culminated in a journal publication, highlighting its contribution to advancing renewable energy technologies.
* Pioneered the development of a groundbreaking MPPT technique that leverages deep reinforcement learning to enhance the performance of the widely used classical method perturb and observe algorithm by mimicking its behavior. Through an innovative approach, this technique learns and adapts to the system's behavior, surpassing the capabilities of its traditional counterpart. This novel method garnered recognition in the form of an international conference paper.
* Spearheaded the development of an innovative MPPT technique tailored for addressing the challenges posed by partial shading in photovoltaic systems. This novel approach combines traditional deep reinforcement learning with insights from classical algorithms, resulting in superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art deep learning methods. The method's effectiveness was rigorously validated through 800 experiments, each comprising 200 dataframes with 14,000 values per frame. In total, approximately 2.5 billion records were processed, necessitating advanced data manipulation techniques such as concatenation, merging, grouping, and averaging. The successful implementation of this method culminated in the awarding of a Ph.D. degree.
